## Welcome to iPatco CMS

My name is [Prashant Rijal](https://www.prashantrijal.com.np/) and I have started the project name 'Project2019' to make simple, free and easy to use CMS in PHP for both developers and the users. I changed the name from Project2019 to iPatco on March of 2019. After that I was being collecting necessary information, tools, and addons for the CMS.

Visit [iPatco Official Website](https://ipatco.net/) to be a contributer for iPatco CMS. Currently iPatco CMS is on development and I am planning to release the alpha version of iPatco CMS within the mid of 2020. Lets see the initial planning and features of iPatco CMS.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ipatco/ipatco.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
